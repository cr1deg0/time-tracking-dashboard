## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This project has given me the opportunity to practice the React, which I'm learning at the moment. In particular, using Hooks, in line styling, emulate a hover event from React and using PropTypes.

I've been pondering wether to use Context to hold the state of the App, but I've decided against it this time as state is only passed down up to a second level component. 

I've resolved the different activity card components image and color styling by using a utilities function that calculates the background color and the image path depending on the data category.
